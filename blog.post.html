      <h1>A heist played like a game of chess</h1>
      <h6>August, 2016</h6>

      "After just being released from a five year stint in prison, Johnny Clay
      has assembled a five man team, including two insiders, to carry out what
      he estimates will be a $2 million heist at Lansdowne Racetrack, that
      take, minus expenses, to be split five ways. Besides Johnny, none of the
      men truly are criminals in the typical sense."
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
      "In addition to the other four team members, Johnny has hired two men
      external to the team to carry out specific functions for a flat fee, the
      other four who will not meet the two men for hire or know who they are,
      while the two men for hire will not be told of the bigger picture of the
      heist."
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
      "None involved are to tell anyone, even their loved ones, about the job,
      each of the five who has a specific reason for wanting his share of the
      money: Johnny, in wanting to get married to his longtime girlfriend Fay,
      the two who have known each other since they were kids, realizes that to
      live comfortably."
